# 3D visualization of data

We made simple web app with very simple interface, it contains only timeline bar and button play, stop and replay speed. 

## Installation

For backend installation, firstly you need install requirements in the ```/back``` dir:

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```

For frontend installation you need install npm packages in the ```/front``` dir:
```bash
npm install
```
## Usage

We made backend for easy test different cases, that we create custom, but we failed realize this, because of time limit. So its enough if you run the front ```npm run dev```. We hardcodedd a dataset into code, so its can be little uncomfortable to manage it :(
